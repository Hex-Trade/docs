# Core

## About Daily Timeframe Algorithms

Daily algorithms hold positions for longer periods than intraday strategies. Key considerations:

- **Fewer trades** — signals fire once per day at most.
- **Larger moves targeted** — designed to capture multi-day trends rather than intraday fluctuations.
- **Overnight risk** — positions may be held overnight and through weekends.
- **Prop firm rules** — some prop firms restrict or prohibit overnight/weekend holds. Check your firm's rules before connecting Core.
