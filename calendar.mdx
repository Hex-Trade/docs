# Economic Calendar

The **Economic calendar** shows upcoming economic events that can move markets.

## What you’ll see

- **List of events** — Dates, times, country/region, and event name (e.g. central bank decisions, employment data, GDP).
- **Importance level** — Often marked (e.g. high, medium, low) so you can focus on the most impactful events.
- **Actual vs forecast** — For past events, actual results vs expectations when available.

## How to use it

1. Open **Economic calendar** from the sidebar.
2. Scroll or use the date range to see past and upcoming events.
3. Plan your trading or risk around high-impact events (e.g. avoid opening large positions right before major news).
4. Use it together with [Analytics](/analytics) and [Trading](/trading) to time your activity.

The calendar is a reference tool only; always do your own research and risk management.
