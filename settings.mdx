# Settings

**Settings** lets you manage your profile and how the app behaves for you.

## Opening settings

Click **Settings** in the sidebar. The settings page may use a different sidebar layout so you have more room for options.

## What you can do

### Profile

- **Profile picture** — Upload or change your avatar. It appears in the header and is stored securely (e.g. via Vercel Blob). Supported image types and a size limit (e.g. 5 MB) apply.
- **Name / email** — View or update your display name and email if the app allows edits here. Some details may be managed through your login provider (e.g. Google).

### App preferences

- **Theme** — Switch between light and dark mode, or follow system preference.
- **Layout** — If the app offers layout options (e.g. sidebar style), you can change them here or in the theme customizer (header/sidebar).
- **Notifications** — Turn notifications on or off, if available.
- **Language / region** — If supported, set language or region.

### Security

- **Password** — Change password if you use email/password login. For “Login with Google,” password is managed in your Google account.
- **Sessions** — View or revoke active sessions if the app shows them.

### Connected accounts and data

- **Trading accounts** — Linking and unlinking brokers is often done from the **Accounts** page; settings may link to that or show a summary.
- **Data and privacy** — Any data export or privacy options the platform offers may appear here or under a dedicated section.

Settings vary by plan and features. If you don’t see an option, it may not be available for your account or region.
