##  Algorithm Metrics

Each algorithm on the Algos page displays key performance data to help you choose the right one:

<Columns cols={2}>
<Card title=" APY" icon="percent">
**Annual Percentage Yield** — The potential annual return based on the algorithm's historical performance.
</Card>
<Card title=" Win Rate" icon="bullseye">
The percentage of trades that closed profitably. A higher win rate indicates more consistent results.
</Card>
<Card title=" Total Trades" icon="list">
Total number of trades executed by the algorithm. Higher volume gives more statistical confidence.
</Card>
<Card title=" Total P&L" icon="dollar-sign">
The algorithm's cumulative **Profit & Loss** over its lifetime — a key indicator of overall performance.
</Card>
</Columns>

<Note>
Many additional metrics are available on each algorithm's detail page — including drawdown, average trade duration, and more.

##  Connecting an Algorithm to Your Account

<Steps>
<Step title="Browse the Algos page">
Visit [dash.hextrade.io/algos](https://dash.hextrade.io/algos) to see all available algorithms.
</Step>
<Step title="Evaluate the metrics">
Review APY, win rate, total trades, and P&L. Click **"View Details"** for a full breakdown including open trades, recent transactions, and supported platforms.
</Step>
<Step title="Check supported platforms">
On the detail page, verify the algorithm supports your connected broker (e.g. ProjectX, Tradovate, Tradier).
</Step>
<Step title="Navigate to Connected Accounts">
In the algorithm's detail page, go to the **Connected Accounts** section.
</Step>
<Step title="Link your account and set risk">
Select the account you want to run the algorithm on.

Configure **risk settings** carefully — each algorithm has guidance on appropriate position sizes.

<Warning>
Exercise **extreme caution** when using mini contract sizes — they carry significantly higher risk than micro contracts. Always ensure your risk management strategy is robust and tested before going live.
</Warning>
</Step>
<Step title="Automation begins">
Once set up, **Hextrade automatically executes trades** based on the algorithm's decisions. Monitor performance in [Analytics](/automated-trading/trading-analytics).
</Step>

## ️ Risk Management

<Warning>
Trading involves risk. Past algorithm performance does not guarantee future results. Always:
- Start with **micro contract sizes** before scaling up
- Review the algorithm's **drawdown history**
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose on any single account
- Monitor your account regularly, especially in volatile markets
</Warning>

##  Tips for Choosing an Algorithm

- **Higher win rate + solid P&L** — Look for algorithms with both, not just one.
- **Volume of trades** — More trades = more statistical confidence in the metrics.
- **Platform compatibility** — Ensure the algorithm supports your broker.
- **Risk level** — Match the algorithm's risk profile to your funded account rules.
- **Free first** — Try free algorithms before committing to premium ones.
