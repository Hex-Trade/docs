## 📋 Key Metrics Explained

| Metric | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| **P&L** | Profit and Loss — total gains minus total losses for the period. |
| **Win Rate** | Percentage of trades that closed in profit. |
| **Drawdown** | The largest peak-to-trough decline in account value — key for risk assessment. |
| **Total Trades** | Number of trades executed; higher volume = more reliable stats. |
| **Avg. Trade Duration** | How long positions are held on average. |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Risk-adjusted return — higher is better. |

## 💡 Using Analytics to Improve

<Tip>
  Use account analytics to compare the performance of different algorithms on different accounts. If one algorithm consistently underperforms on a specific broker, consider pausing it and trying another.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Monitor **drawdown** closely on funded prop accounts. Most prop firms have a maximum drawdown rule — breaching it will get your account flagged.
</Tip>

- **Compare accounts** — Side-by-side comparison of algorithms running across different brokers.
- **Identify losing periods** — Use the calendar view to spot days or weeks with poor performance.
- **Adjust risk** — If analytics show high drawdown, reduce position sizing or algorithm risk settings.
- **Combine with the Calendar** — Check the [Economic Calendar](/other-features/economic-calendar) to correlate losses with major market events.
