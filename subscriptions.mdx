# Subscriptions

The **Subscriptions** page shows your active plans and what algorithms or features they unlock.

## What you’ll see

- **Your subscriptions** — Which plans you’re on and their status (active, expired, etc.).
- **What’s included** — Which algorithms or features each subscription gives you access to.
- **Limits** — Account limits, group limits, or other caps tied to your plan.

## How it works

- Some **algorithms** on Hextrade require a subscription. If you try to use one and don’t have access, you’ll see a message and can go to Subscriptions to upgrade or subscribe.
- Your **account limit** (e.g. number of trading accounts) can depend on your plan; the Accounts page will show your limit.
- **Copy-trade groups** may also be limited by your subscription.

## Managing subscriptions

1. Open **Subscriptions** from the sidebar.
2. View your current plan(s) and what they include.
3. To change plan or subscribe to more, use the upgrade or subscribe options on the page (or follow any link to your billing/provider).
4. After upgrading, new limits and algorithm access apply as per your plan.

If you have “unlimited” status (e.g. from a special plan), some limits may not apply; the dashboard will reflect that.
