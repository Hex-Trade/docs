## What is Hextrade?

Hextrade is an **AI copy-trade platform** that blends automation with AI. You can:

- Use **Hextrade algorithms** — ready-made strategies you subscribe to and run on your accounts.
- Connect **your own logic** — via TradingView webhooks or external algorithms.
- **Copy trade** — one master account leads; follower accounts copy trades automatically.
- **Trade manually** — full-screen charts and order entry with supported brokers.
