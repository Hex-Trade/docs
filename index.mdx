# Welcome To Hextrade

Welcome to the **Hextrade** documentation. This guide covers everything you need to use the platform — from creating your account and connecting a broker, to running algorithms and setting up copy trading.

Hextrade is a **copy-trade platform** that blends automation with AI. You can use our built-in algorithms, copy trades across multiple accounts with different risk profiles, or connect your own strategy via a **TradingView webhook**.

<Note>
  Hextrade is currently in **Beta**. Features are actively being developed. Join our [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/hextrade) to give feedback, report issues, and follow updates.
