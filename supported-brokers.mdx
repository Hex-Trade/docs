# Supported Brokers & Accounts

Hextrade lets you connect **multiple broker accounts** so you can trade, run algorithms, and copy trade from one dashboard. Each account appears on the [Accounts](/accounts) page with its platform, balance, and P&L.

## What “supported” means

- **Connect** — Link your broker account to Hextrade via the dashboard (OAuth or API keys as required by the broker).
- **See in one place** — All connected accounts appear on [Accounts](/accounts) with portfolio value, completed trades, and active count.
- **Trade** — Use the [Trade](/trading) page to place orders on the selected account (market, limit, stop, etc., per broker).
- **Algorithms** — Run Hextrade algorithms on connected accounts that support the required order types.
- **Copy trade** — Use any connected account as master or follower in [Copy Trade](/copy-trade) groups.

## Connecting an account

1. Open **[Accounts](/accounts)** from the sidebar.
2. Use **Add account** (or equivalent) and choose the broker (e.g. Tradier, DxTrade, Alpaca).
3. Complete the broker’s sign-in or API key flow. Hextrade will not store your broker password; we use OAuth or tokens where possible.
4. After connection, the account appears in the Accounts table with its name, platform, and status.
5. You can open **Account stats** for that account to see performance and history.

Account limits depend on your [subscription](/subscriptions). If you hit the limit, you’ll see a message; upgrade your plan to add more accounts.
