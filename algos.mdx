# Algos (Algorithms)

**Algos** lets you browse and use trading algorithms on Hextrade.

## What are algorithms?

Algorithms are automated or semi-automated trading strategies. Hextrade lets you run our algorithms or connect your own (for example via TradingView webhook).

## What you’ll see

- **Algorithms list** — All available algorithms. You can browse by name, performance, or status.
- **Algorithm detail** — Open a specific algorithm to see:
- Description and how it works
- Performance and stats
- Settings and risk level
- Subscription or usage requirements

## How to use an algorithm

1. Open **Algos** from the sidebar.
2. Browse the list and click the algorithm you want.
3. On the algorithm’s page, read the description and performance.
4. If it’s subscription-based, ensure you have an active subscription (see [Subscriptions](/subscriptions)).
5. Connect your account(s) or enable the algorithm for your account as shown on the page.
6. The algorithm will run according to its rules; you can monitor it from the dashboard.

## Subscriptions

Some algorithms require a subscription. Check **Subscriptions** to see your active plans and manage them. If an algo is locked, you’ll be prompted to subscribe.
