# Copy Trade

**Copy Trade** lets you create groups where one account (the **master**) leads and other accounts (**followers**) copy its trades.

## What you’ll see

On the Copy Trade page you’ll see:

- **Total groups** — Number of copy-trade groups you’ve created.
- **Active groups** — Groups that are currently copying trades.
- **Total followers** — Total follower accounts across all groups.

A **table lists your groups** with name, master account, number of followers, status (active/inactive), success rate, and other stats.

## Create a copy-trade group

1. Open **Copy Trade** from the sidebar.
2. Click **Add group** (or similar).
3. **Name the group** and add an optional description.
4. **Choose the master account** — the account whose trades will be copied.
5. **Add follower accounts** — the accounts that will copy the master’s trades.
6. Set **risk level** (e.g. low, medium, high) if the option is available.
7. Save. The group can be set to **Active** so copying starts.

## Manage groups

- **View** — Open a group to see details, master, and followers.
- **Activate / deactivate** — Turn copying on or off for a group.
- **Edit** — Change name, description, master, or followers.
- **Delete** — Remove a group (with confirmation).

## How copying works

When the group is **active**, trades placed on the **master** account are replicated to the **follower** accounts according to the platform’s copy logic (size, risk, etc.). Monitor the group’s stats and success rate on the Copy Trade page.

## Limits

You may have a limit on how many groups you can create. If you see a limit message, check your plan or contact support.
