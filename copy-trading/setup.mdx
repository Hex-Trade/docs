#  Setting up Copy Trading

Copy trading on Hextrade lets you efficiently manage **multiple accounts with different risk profiles** from a single dashboard. One account acts as the **master** — any trade it makes is automatically replicated across all **follower** accounts in the group.

Visit [**dash.hextrade.io/copy-trade-groups**](https://dash.hextrade.io/copy-trade-groups) to get started.

## ️ Creating a Copy Trade Group

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Copy Trade Groups">
Visit [dash.hextrade.io/copy-trade-groups](https://dash.hextrade.io/copy-trade-groups) and click **"Add Group"**.
</Step>
<Step title="Enter a group name">
Give your group a distinctive, memorable name that reflects the strategy (e.g. "NQ Scalp — Low Risk" or "Tradovate Primary").
</Step>
<Step title="Add a description (recommended)">
Use the description field to document the strategy's logic, source, or any notes for future reference. This is especially useful when managing multiple groups.
</Step>
<Step title="Select the master account">
Choose the **master account** — this is the account whose trades will be copied to all followers. It should be the account running your main algorithm or strategy.
</Step>
<Step title="Add follower accounts">
Select one or more **follower accounts**. These can be accounts across different brokers (all must be connected — see [Trading Accounts](/automated-trading/trading-accounts)).
</Step>
<Step title="Set the risk multiplier">
Define the **risk multiplier** for each follower:
- `1.0` = same position size as master
- `0.5` = half the size (lower risk)
- `2.0` = double the size (higher risk)

<Warning>
Always tailor the multiplier to each account's available capital and prop firm rules. Running a high multiplier on a funded account can lead to rule violations.
</Warning>
</Step>
<Step title="Save and activate">
Click **Save**. Set the group status to **Active** to begin copying trades immediately.
</Step>
</Steps>

##  Managing Groups

Once a group is created, you can:

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **View** | Open a group to see the master, followers, trade history, and stats. |
| **Activate / Deactivate** | Toggle the group on or off. Deactivated groups stop copying trades. |
| **Edit** | Change the name, description, master, followers, or risk multiplier. |
| **Delete** | Remove the group entirely (with confirmation). Followers are not affected. |

##  What You'll See on the Copy Trade Page

At the top, summary stats give you a quick overview:

- **Total groups** — How many groups you've created.
- **Active groups** — Groups currently copying trades.
- **Total followers** — Combined follower count across all groups.
- **Success rate** — Average % of copied trades that closed in profit.

The groups table lists each group with its master account, follower count, status (active/inactive), success rate, and total P&L.

##  Tips for Effective Copy Trading

<Tip>
Use **different risk multipliers** across follower accounts to diversify risk. For example, run 0.5x on your most sensitive funded account and 1.0x on a personal account.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Pair copy trading with [Trading Analytics](/automated-trading/trading-analytics) to monitor group performance and catch any issues early.
</Tip>

<Note>
Follower accounts must be on a **supported platform**. Not all broker combinations support cross-platform copying — verify compatibility on the [Trading Accounts](/automated-trading/trading-accounts) page.
</Note>
