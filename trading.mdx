# Trading

The **Trade** page is a full-screen trading view with charts and order placement.

## Opening the trading page

1. Click **Trade** in the sidebar (or use the link from your dashboard).
2. The page opens in full-screen mode (no sidebar) so you have more space for charts and orders.

## What you’ll see

- **Chart** — Price chart (TradingView-style). You can switch symbols, timeframes, and chart type.
- **Order panel** — Place market, limit, or stop orders (buy/sell).
- **Positions / orders** — Your open positions and order status when available.
- **Account selector** — Choose which connected account to trade with, if you have more than one.

## Placing orders

1. Select the **symbol** and **account**.
2. Choose **order type** (e.g. market, limit, stop) and **side** (buy/sell).
3. Enter **quantity** and, for limit/stop orders, **price** (and stop price if needed).
4. Submit the order. Confirm any summary or confirmation step if the platform shows one.

Order types and fields depend on the connected broker (e.g. Tradier, DxTrade, Alpaca). The trading page reflects what your broker supports.

## Chart customization

You can change how the chart looks (colors, candles, grid, volume) from **Chart settings** in the sidebar or from the trading UI. See [Chart settings](/chart-settings) for details.

## Options

If your account and broker support it, you can trade **options** from the **Options** page in the sidebar. Use it to place single-leg or multi-leg options strategies when available.
