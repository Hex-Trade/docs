##  Trading Around News Events

<Warning>
**High-impact events** (e.g. NFP, FOMC decisions, CPI) can cause spreads to widen dramatically and slippage to increase. Many prop firm rules prohibit holding positions through certain news events — always check your broker's and prop firm's policies.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Pair the Economic Calendar with [Copy Trading](/copy-trading/setup) — you can temporarily **deactivate** copy groups before high-impact events and reactivate after the dust settles.
</Tip>

##  Why Geopolitical Events Matter

Geopolitical stability — or instability — is a powerful driver of market sentiment:

| Event type | Market impact |
|------------|---------------|
| Central bank rate decisions | Forex, bonds, indices |
| Elections & political uncertainty | Currencies, local indices |
| Trade agreements / tariffs | Equities, commodities |
| War / conflict | Safe havens (gold, USD, JPY) |
| Employment data | Equities, forex, indices |
| Inflation data (CPI/PPI) | Bonds, forex, crypto |

By tracking these events on the Hextrade calendar, you can **minimize unexpected losses** and position yourself to capitalize on predictable volatility.
