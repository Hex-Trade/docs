# Images for Hextrade docs

Place these image files in this folder (or in the `images/` folder at the root of your **Hex-Trade/docs** repo) so they appear in the Mintlify docs.

| File | Used on | Suggested content |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------ |
| `dashboard-welcome.png` | Welcome (index) | Screenshot of the main dashboard / Accounts overview. |
| `accounts-overview.png` | Accounts | Screenshot of the Accounts page (portfolio value, trades, account list). |
| `trading-page.png` | Trading | Screenshot of the Trade page (chart and order panel). |
| `copy-trade-groups.png` | Copy Trade | Screenshot of the Copy Trade page (groups table and stats). |

Use PNG or JPG. Keep file sizes reasonable (e.g. under 500 KB) for fast loading. If a file is missing, the doc will show a broken image until you add it.
