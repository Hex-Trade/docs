# Analytics

The **Analytics** page gives you performance data and insights across your trading activity.

## What you’ll see

- **Charts and metrics** — Visual and numerical views of your performance over time.
- **Key stats** — Returns, win rate, drawdown, or other metrics depending on what’s available.
- **Breakdowns** — By account, strategy, or time period so you can see what’s working.

## How to use it

1. Open **Analytics** from the sidebar.
2. Use the date range or filters (if available) to focus on a specific period or account.
3. Review the main metrics and charts to understand your results.
4. Use the data to adjust strategies, risk, or which algorithms or copy groups you use.

Analytics works with your connected accounts and copy-trade groups, so the more you use the platform, the more useful the analytics become.
