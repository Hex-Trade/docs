##  Google Sign-Up (Faster Option)

Prefer a quicker setup? Skip the email form entirely.

1. On the registration page, click the **Google icon**.
2. Select your Google account.
3. Grant the required permissions.
4. You'll be taken straight to your Hextrade dashboard — no email verification needed.

##  Password Requirements

For a strong and secure password we recommend:

- At least **8 characters**
- A mix of **uppercase and lowercase** letters
- At least one **number**
- At least one **special character** (e.g. `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`)

<Warning>
Never share your password. Hextrade staff will never ask for your password. Enable two-factor authentication from [Account Utilities](/get-started/account-utilities) once logged in.
