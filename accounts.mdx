# Accounts

The **Accounts** page is your home after login. It shows your connected trading accounts and overall activity.

## What you’ll see

At the top you’ll see summary cards:

- **Portfolio value** — Total value across your accounts (updates with live P&L when available).
- **Completed trades** — Number of completed trades.
- **Active accounts** — How many accounts you have connected.
- **Account limit** — Your plan’s account limit (e.g. up to 20 accounts).

Below that, a **table lists your accounts** with details for each (name, platform, status, P&L, etc.).

## What you can do

- **View all accounts** — See every connected account in one place.
- **Open account stats** — Click an account to see its detailed statistics and performance.
- **Use shared reports** — Use the shared report view to see or share report data.
- **Add accounts** — Connect new trading accounts from the dashboard (subject to your account limit and plan).

## Account stats

From the accounts list you can open **Account stats** for a single account. There you get:

- Performance and balance for that account
- Trade history and P&L
- Other account-specific metrics

## Limits

Your subscription or plan may limit how many accounts you can add. If you hit the limit, you’ll see a message; upgrade or adjust your plan in **Subscriptions** if you need more.
