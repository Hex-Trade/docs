# Accounts

The **Accounts** page is your home after login. It shows every **connected broker account** in one place: portfolio value, completed trades, and a clear view of your account limit.

---

## What you’ll see

At the top, summary cards give you the big picture:

| Card | What it shows |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| **Portfolio value** | Total value across all connected accounts. Updates with live P&L when available. |
| **Completed trades** | Total number of completed trades across accounts. |
| **Active accounts** | How many broker accounts you have connected. |
| **Account limit** | Your plan’s maximum accounts (e.g. up to 20). Upgrade in [Subscriptions](/subscriptions) for more. |

Below that, a **table lists each account** with:

- Account name and **broker/platform** (e.g. Tradier, DxTrade, Alpaca)
- Status (connected, error, etc.)
- P&L and performance where available
- Quick actions (e.g. open stats, disconnect)

## What you can do

- **View all accounts** — See every connected account and its broker in one table.
- **Open account stats** — Click an account to see detailed statistics, balance, and trade history for that account.
- **Use shared reports** — Use the shared report view to see or share report data across accounts.
- **Add accounts** — Connect new broker accounts via **Add account** (subject to your [account limit](#limits)).

---

## Account stats

From the accounts list, open **Account stats** for a single account. You get:

- Performance and balance for that account only
- Trade history and P&L
- Other account-specific metrics the broker provides

Use this to compare performance across brokers or to audit a single account.

---

## Limits

Your [subscription](/subscriptions) or plan sets how many accounts you can add. When you hit the limit:

- The dashboard will show a message when you try to add another account.
- Upgrade or change your plan in **Subscriptions** to increase the limit.
- Some plans (e.g. “unlimited”) allow higher or no cap; the Accounts page reflects your current limit.

Need more than one broker? Connect each broker account separately; each connection counts toward your account limit.
